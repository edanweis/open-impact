Edan's notes
---

I'm using virtualenvwrapper on the server to manage my virtual environment, using "flask" as my environment. Use of "#!/usr/bin/python" on first line of python scripts may need to be deleted?

See notes on db_migrate.py and db_upgrade to update server

might want to switch to using flask-migrate and alanby instead of sqlalchemy-migrate which is no longer maintained.
